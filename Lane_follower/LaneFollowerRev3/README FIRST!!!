How to control the robot:

ONLY USE "k" (linear = 0, angular = 0) to stop the robot when at the crosswalk or in the inner path so the robot does not ram into the car

NEVER USE "j" or "l": the robot should never have 0 linear velocity but nonzero angular velocity. (robot should never turn in place) 

At turns, some combination of "u/o" (these make the robot turn) and "i" (going straight). 


- On straight path
	- Correct for being in the white lines but going slightly off
	- Correct for going on the green
	
- When at cross walk
	- Only go when the pedestrian is *far* off the road
	- Stop when pedstrian is in the middle
	- Sometimes the car will be at a weird angle at the intersection. What to do here. 

- At inner path
	- When there is no inner car 
	- When there is inner car (learning to stop when behind inner car), keep a *generous* distance
	- Recovering for going onto the green path (this also has multiple cases)
	
- Going in and coming out the inner path
	- With no inner car around
	- With inner car  

- At turns
	- Turn nicely. This can often be done using a single press of "u" or "o"

- Ramming into
	- Trees
	- Parked cars
	- World boundary
	Only have images where we are recovering from them
