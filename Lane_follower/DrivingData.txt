Set 1: Drove 2 laps around the outer path. Control probably wasn't ideal, I had to make a bunch of adjustments and tuned accidentally a couple of times.
Set 2: Drove 2 laps around the outer path. Mostly smooth driving.
Set 3: Didn't drive very far, tried to stop to avoid pedestrian but just tipped over (not sure if this is very useful haha)
Set 4: Drove 2 laps around the outer path, smooth driving & went cw instead of ccw.
Set 5: Drove from outer path to inner path, then hit truck :(
