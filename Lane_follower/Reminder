Hello :)

- Remember to make DrivingRecorder.py an executable
- The linear speed should be: 0.55 
- The angular speed should be: 5.05447028499
- Remember to move the data to a new folder everytime you run the simulation, otherwise the data will be overwritten! (Unless you decide to have a separate launch file for the DrivingRecorder node)
